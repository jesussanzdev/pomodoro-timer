The Pomodoro Technique uses a timer to break down work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks. Each interval is known as a pomodoro, from the Italian word for 'tomato'.

The technique has been widely popularized by dozens of apps and websites providing timers and instructions.

I developed this app with react, redux and bootstrap among other technologies. It is preferably developed for use on a desktop screen but can also be used on other portable devices.
